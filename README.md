# CodAlpha_Task
---
Welcome to the official repository for my **CodeAlpha Artificial Intelligence Internship ‚Äì July-August Batch**.  
This repository contains the completed solutions for all three assigned tasks, developed using Python and various modern libraries for AI, GUI, and Computer Vision.

Each task is organized in its own folder with full source code, README, and requirements for easy execution.

## Applications Overview:

### 1. Language Translator (Lang_app.py)

This application provides a user-friendly interface for translating text between multiple languages.

**Features:**
* **Text Translation:** Translate input text from a source language to a target language using the Google Translate API.
* **Language Selection:** Supports a wide range of languages through dropdown menus.
* **Copy Functionality:** Easily copy the translated text to your clipboard.
* **Text-to-Speech:** Listen to the translated text using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

**Technologies Used:**
* `tkinter`: For the graphical user interface.
* `googletrans`: For accessing the Google Translate API.
* `gTTS`: For text-to-speech conversion.
* `pyperclip`: For clipboard operations.
* `playsound`: For playing audio.

### 2. AI FAQ Bot (AI_FAQs Bot.py)

An interactive chatbot designed to answer frequently asked questions about Artificial Intelligence.

**Features:**
* **Natural Language Understanding:** Processes user questions to find the most relevant answer from a predefined set of FAQs.
* **TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity:** Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for intelligent question matching.
* **Voice Output:** The bot can speak its responses using a text-to-speech engine.
* **Conversational Flow:** Handles greetings, farewells, and provides helpful information related to AI concepts, applications, and ethical considerations.

**Technologies Used:**
* `tkinter`: For the chatbot's GUI.
* `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks, including stopwords removal.
* `sklearn`: For TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity calculations.
* `pyttsx3`: For text-to-speech functionality.

### 3. Object ID App (ObjID_app.py)

This application combines YOLOv5u for object detection and Deep SORT for real-time object tracking in video streams or files.

**Features:**
* **Real-time Object Detection:** Identifies objects in a video feed (webcam or uploaded file) using the YOLOv5u model.
* **Multi-Object Tracking:** Assigns unique IDs to detected objects and tracks their movement across frames using the Deep SORT algorithm.
* **Video Input:** Supports both live webcam feed and pre-recorded video files.
* **Graphical User Interface:** Displays the video stream with bounding boxes and tracking IDs.

**Technologies Used:**
* `opencv-python` (`cv2`): For video capture, processing, and display.
* `ultralytics` (`YOLO`): For loading and running the YOLOv5u object detection model.
* `deep_sort_realtime`: For real-time multi-object tracking.
* `tkinter`: For the GUI elements (buttons, video display).
* `Pillow` (`PIL`): For image manipulation within the Tkinter GUI.
